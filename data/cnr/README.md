The data submitted correspond to the APCs used by CNR authors within the transformative agreements subscribed by the National Research Council (NRC) with the following publishers:

American Chemical Society (ACS)
American Institute of Physics (AIP)
Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)
Springer

The contract with the IEEE publisher is not an actual TA but an agreement to purchase a package of APCs (Gold OA journals) paid for by the CNR and, therefore, not charged to the authors.

CRUI-CARE manages the other transformative contracts in which the CNR participates.

The currency of the amounts reported is in euros (â‚¬).
Costs of APCs based on other currencies have been converted using an exchange rate based on an expected date (October each year).
